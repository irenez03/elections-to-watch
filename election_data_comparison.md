## üö® **Critical Issues:**

1. **Wrong Election Type**: Map shows federal elections that don't exist in 2025
2. **Missing Real Elections**: Major gubernatorial races (NJ, VA) not included
3. **Incorrect Dates**: Most elections are local with varying dates, not November 4
4. **Missing States**: Many states with significant elections not included

## ‚úÖ **Recommended Actions:**

1. **Update Map Focus**: Change from federal to local/state elections
2. **Add Missing States**: Include NJ, VA, TN, OK, and others with major races
3. **Correct Election Types**: Replace Senate/House with mayoral, gubernatorial, local races
4. **Update Dates**: Use actual election dates from CSV (many are not November 4)
5. **Add Referendums**: Include ballot measures and constitutional amendments
