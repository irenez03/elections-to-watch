├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        © 2025 Elections to Watch        │

#### Styling Features:

### 3. ✅ Lottery Animation for Statistics
**Numbers count up from 0 on page load**

#### Animation Details:
- **Easing function**: Smooth cubic deceleration
- **Duration**: 1000-1200ms per number
- **Staggered start**: Each number starts 100ms after previous
- **Effect**: Creates a "lottery" or "slot machine" counting effect

#### Animation Sequence:
1. States Tracked (0ms delay, 1200ms duration)
2. Total Elections (100ms delay, 1200ms duration)
3. Local (200ms delay, 1000ms duration)
4. State (300ms delay, 1000ms duration)
5. U.S. House (400ms delay, 1000ms duration)
6. Referendums (500ms delay, 1000ms duration)

#### Technical Implementation:
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
- Easing: `1 - (1 - progress)³` for natural deceleration
- Ensures final value is exact (no rounding errors)
- Numbers count from 0 to their final values
